# while
### while(condition){statement}
### as long as the statement is true statement is executed
## while(val <=10){sum += val; ++val;} // assign sum + val to sum and add 1 to val 

# compound assignment operator
### += operator adds its right hand operand to left hand operand and stores the result in the left hand operand ;
### sum = sum + val;  

# pre and post increment
int x = 5;
int y = ++x; // x is incremented to 6, then y is assigned the value of x (6)


int x = 5;
int y = x++; // y is assigned the value of x (5), then x is incremented to 6


 #include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main (){
    int sum =0 ; int value =0;
    while(cin>>value){
        sum += value;
    }
    cout<<"sum is :"<<sum<<endl;
} 

### This example let me enter all the numbers  i want until i end the file by pressing ctrl+z and enter and then sum is generated from those numbers eg if i put 1 2 3 and then end the line i will get sum: 6
