C++ Live Learning Sessions
Welcome to my C++ Live Learning Sessions repository! ðŸš€
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning C++ through live coding sessions and the book "C++ Primer". Here, I document my progress, share notes, and include the code and concepts I learn along the way.

ðŸ“– Learning Resource
I am using the following book for this journey:

C++ Primer (5th Edition) by Stanley B. Lippman, JosÃ©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo
This book provides a comprehensive understanding of C++ programming, covering the fundamentals and advanced topics.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Develop a strong foundation in C++ programming.
Understand key concepts like:
Basics of C++ (Syntax, Variables, and Types)
Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism)
Standard Template Library (STL)
Advanced topics like Templates, Exception Handling, and Multithreading
Build small projects and exercises from the book to reinforce learning.
Document my learning journey through detailed notes and logs.
